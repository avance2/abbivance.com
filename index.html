      <p class="title">Best Design Advice</p>
      <p>Honestly, everyone works so much differently that I'm not sure what works for me would work for anyone else. 
<br>
          All I know is...
          <br>
          There will be late nights where you wish you would've gotten up an hour earlier to start your day, or not gone to spend time with your friends and instead stayed home to work on projects.
          <br>
          There will be anxiety/panic attacks while you stress out about grades and assignment due dates no matter how many times your professor told you the deadline didn't matter.
          <br>
          There will be times when you feel like you aren't good at anything and everything because you're so frustrated with getting it perfect.
          <br>
          There will be times when personal and professional lives need to be separated from a project no matter how attached you feel to it.
          <br>
          but...
          <br>
          There will also be times when a professor's smallest of comments toward your work will boost your confidence through the roof.
          <br>
          There will be times when you let yourself go to just create whatever comes to mind and it ends up being the best thing you've done.
          <br>
          There will be times when you feel so proud of your work you want to show it off to the world.
          <br>
          There will be times when you know why you fell in love with this field. 
          <br>
          So I don't know any advice to give quite yet, because I'm just starting out, but I know there will be times good, bad and indifferent that will shape us into the best designer we can be.</p>

      <p class="title">My Crazy Beautiful Life</p>
      <p>About three years ago I applied to Eastern only knowing, from one visit, that I wanted to pursue my education in Visual Communication Design.
          <br>
          A month and a half ago I thought I would be walking across the stage at Commencement on June 16th to receive my diploma (cover). I would finish my degree over the summer by taking my final class at Eastern while also working at Housing and Residential Life.
          <br>
          About a month ago I made the crazy decision to apply for the BFA in VCD, and got in despite my pessimistic outlook on life...just in case I didn't succeed.
          <br>
          About three weeks ago I figured out my plan for how I was going to finish my new degree in the next year at EWU while still making the most out of my time here.
          <br>
          About two weeks ago I applied for a new job and had an interview within 3 days of applying.
          <br>
          About a week ago I accepted the job offer.
          <br>
          About 3 years ago, you couldn't have convinced me my life would have so many positives coming at me one after another. That it seems like good things are just falling into my lap left and right, like I'm always in the right place doing the right things at the right times despite the obstacles that occur in between, like I'm where I'm supposed to be. </p>

     I’ve been pretty bad at posting photos from the places I’ve visited in the last two weeks (mostly because I’ve come down with the flu and because I’m always on the go) so here are some selfies my friends and I took while in every city and a little update about what I’ve done so far.
     <br>
Last time I uploaded photos they were of London, from there we trained to Glasgow, Scotland for a couple days before taking a bus to Edinburgh (Edin-brah), Scotland to spend 36hrs. After Scotland we flew to Dublin, Ireland where the four of us spent our last days before the three headed back for the US and I stayed to continue my journey East to Germany where I currently am staying with Paulina!
<br>
In Scotland we visited many cathedrals and museums, went on a pub crawl until 1 a.m., and saw “the birthplace of Harry Potter” (aka where JK Rowling spent her days in a cafe writing).
<br>
In Dublin we visited cathedrals again, whiskey distilleries and even became an official Guinness pourer at none other than the Guinness Factory and Store House.
<br>
Germany is just getting underway so I will leave that until next update hopefully once I get to Italy.
<br>
<ul>Here are some things I’ve taken away so far:
<li>1. I know nothing about the cities I have visited/going to visit and have learned so much more than I planned</li>
<li>2. My spontaneous friends are to thank for steam rolling this idea of going on a trip for winter break</li>
<li>3. It doesn’t feel like Christmas is in a couple days and I don’t know how my family will have a Christmas without me, but I thank them for letting me leave and experience this</li>
<li>4. I’ve got a travel bug that isn’t going away soon</li>
<li>5. Beer is gross</li>
</ul>
