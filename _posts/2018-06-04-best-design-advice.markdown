Honestly, everyone works so much differently that I'm not sure what works for me would work for anyone else. 

All I know is...

There will be late nights where you wish you would've gotten up an hour earlier to start your day, or not gone to spend time with your friends and instead stayed home to work on projects.

There will be anxiety/panic attacks while you stress out about grades and assignment due dates no matter how many times your professor told you the deadline didn't matter.

There will be times when you feel like you aren't good at anything and everything because you're so frustrated with getting it perfect.

There will be times when personal and professional lives need to be separated from a project no matter how attached you feel to it.

but...

There will also be times when a professor's smallest of comments toward your work will boost your confidence through the roof.

There will be times when you let yourself go to just create whatever comes to mind and it ends up being the best thing you've done.

There will be times when you feel so proud of your work you want to show it off to the world.

There will be times when you know why you fell in love with this field. 

So I don't know any advice to give quite yet, because I'm just starting out, but I know there will be times good, bad and indifferent that will shape us into the best designer we can be.
