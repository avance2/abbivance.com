About three years ago I applied to Eastern only knowing, from one visit, that I wanted to pursue my education in Visual Communication Design.

A month and a half ago I thought I would be walking across the stage at Commencement on June 16th to receive my diploma (cover). I would finish my degree over the summer by taking my final class at Eastern while also working at Housing and Residential Life.

About a month ago I made the crazy decision to apply for the BFA in VCD, and got in despite my pessimistic outlook on life...just in case I didn't succeed.

About three weeks ago I figured out my plan for how I was going to finish my new degree in the next year at EWU while still making the most out of my time here.

About two weeks ago I applied for a new job and had an interview within 3 days of applying.

About a week ago I accepted the job offer.

About 3 years ago, you couldn't have convinced me my life would have so many positives coming at me one after another. That it seems like good things are just falling into my lap left and right, like I'm always in the right place doing the right things at the right times despite the obstacles that occur in between, like I'm where I'm supposed to be.
