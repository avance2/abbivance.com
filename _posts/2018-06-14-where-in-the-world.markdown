I’ve been pretty bad at posting photos from the places I’ve visited in the last two weeks (mostly because I’ve come down with the flu and because I’m always on the go) so here are some selfies my friends and I took while in every city and a little update about what I’ve done so far.

Last time I uploaded photos they were of London, from there we trained to Glasgow, Scotland for a couple days before taking a bus to Edinburgh (Edin-brah), Scotland to spend 36hrs. After Scotland we flew to Dublin, Ireland where the four of us spent our last days before the three headed back for the US and I stayed to continue my journey East to Germany where I currently am staying with Paulina!

In Scotland we visited many cathedrals and museums, went on a pub crawl until 1 a.m., and saw “the birthplace of Harry Potter” (aka where JK Rowling spent her days in a cafe writing).

In Dublin we visited cathedrals again, whiskey distilleries and even became an official Guinness pourer at none other than the Guinness Factory and Store House.

Germany is just getting underway so I will leave that until next update hopefully once I get to Italy.

Here are some things I’ve taken away so far:
1. I know nothing about the cities I have visited/going to visit and have learned so much more than I planned
2. My spontaneous friends are to thank for steam rolling this idea of going on a trip for winter break
3. It doesn’t feel like Christmas is in a couple days and I don’t know how my family will have a Christmas without me, but I thank them for letting me leave and experience this
4. I’ve got a travel bug that isn’t going away soon
5. Beer is gross
