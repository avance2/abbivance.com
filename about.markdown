My name is Abigail Vance, but I go by Abbi (yes with just an “I”). I’m currently in my third year of schooling at Eastern, set to graduate in Spring 2019 with my BFA in Visual Communication Design with a User Experience Certificate as my minor. 

Through my time in high school and in college I’ve always been super busy and involved. At Eastern, I’m currently the president of a club called The Eagle Ambassadors. Through this club, partnered closely with Admissions, we are in charge of student recruitment. We volunteer and run events like Open House, Admitted Student Day, Eagle Preview, hold panels for visiting guest groups and give tours to potential students and their families. I’ve been a part of this club for three years and have put in over 350 hours of volunteer time. During my time as The Eagle Ambassador president, I have proficiently managed the ability to multi-task personal and professional tasks. This has also allowed me to work in a collaborative team environment and I am eager to take my leadership and design skills to the next level and apply them in an even more professional setting. 

Aside from volunteering, I’ve been fortunate enough to gain job experience in my field through working on campus. My first two years on campus I worked at the student newspaper, The Easterner, where I worked as a page designer and occasionally created adds or illustrations, then worked as the Art Director. Currently, I work for Housing & Residential Life as their graphics assistant and have gained more insight into the type of work I will be and want to be doing. 

When finished with my degree I would like to move back to the Westside and work either in the Olympia or Seattle area for a while, but would gladly take a job on this side of the mountains to get me started. I’m most interested in doing packaging and/or promotional & marketing pieces for a company. My big dream is to work for Amazon, Nike, or Disney one day as an Art Director.
